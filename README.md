# Daemons

Source of truth for Amit's local daemon implementations.

## Repository contract

- Daemon implementation code lives in this repository.
- Profiles (`/Users/amittiwari/Profiles`) may expose commands globally through PATH wrappers and shell sourcing, but should delegate daemon behavior here.
- Codex-related daemons live under `codex/<daemon-name>/`.
- Daemon internals should be namespaced under the daemon name.

## Global shell entrypoints

Profiles sources this file when available:

```zsh
source /Users/amittiwari/Projects/Tools-Utilities/daemons/aliases.zsh
```

That keeps global commands available while this repository remains the source of truth.

## Current daemons

- [`codex/ai-cmux-conductor`](./codex/ai-cmux-conductor) — `aicc`, a cMUX AI workspace conductor that opens Codex with `cxscb`, places Claude to the right, can optionally place Devin below Claude via a feature flag, and names the workspace after the current project.
